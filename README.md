# AlphaZero-general

This is a general-purpose AlphaZero implementation (work in progress) that aims to provide a flexible framework for training and playing games. It currently focuses on a specific game and will expand to include additional games in the future.

## Issue
- **2023-06-25**  
I have trained connect4 game for 12 hours and tested recent model against older models.
But recent model does not outperform.
I think this is due to mcts.
I'll try to fix this issue soon.


## Installation
